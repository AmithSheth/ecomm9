Adding new reports
-------------------

Create a class that inherits from `Spree::Report` and define a `report_query` method. If the report is to be paginated. it should define also define a method called `paginated` and set it to return `true` alongwith defining `paginated_report_query` and `record_count_query`. the `_query` methods should return objects that respond to `to_sql` which returns sql string for reporting query.

All reports need to define the following constants:
1.  `SORTABLE_ATTRIBUTES`: Other attributes based on which reports can be sorted.
2.  `DEFAULT_SORTABLE_ATTRIBUTE`: The attribute which is used by default to sort the report results.
3.  `HEADERS`: The static header fields for report. Note time based fields are automatically added. Any field not declared here but available in observation will be ignored while displaying the report.
4.  `SEARCH_ATTRIBUTES`: A hash containing the attributes and their name on frontend based on which report result can be filtered.

Additionally they need to define two nested classes. `Result` and `Result::Observation`.

`Result` class can inherit from `Spree::Report::Result` if it is a basic report or from `Spree::Report::TimedResult` if the result can be time scaled(i.e. changing reporting period changes the scale of report).

Similarly Observation class needs to inherit either from `Spree::Report::Observation` or `Spree::Report::TimedObservation`. It defines a macro call `observation_fields` which can be passed an array or hash with default values of fields which form one report item. Create a method of same name in Observation class for virtual fields which are not returned by queries. ie. average or for formatting db results.

`TimedResult` has 2 lifecycle methods which can be overriden for customizing the report output.
1. `build_empty_observations`: Generates empty observations which are later filled with datapoints returned by report query.
2. `populate_observations`: Fill the empty observations with data returned via query.

`TimedObservation` defines a describes? method which can be overriden to change where the query results gets copied to.

You can add charts to reports by calling `charts` with a list of classes representing the chart. Each chart implementing class gets the results in it's initializer and need to implement to_h method returning the json representation of chart.

Finally, register the report in initializer `solidus_admin_insights.rb` in its appropriate category or make a new category to make it available in admin dashboard.


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rspec spec
```
